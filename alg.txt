Java Program on RSA Algorithm
RSA algorithm is an asymmetric cryptography algorithm. Asymmetric means that it works on two different keys i.e. Public Key and Private Key. As the name suggests that the Public Key is given to everyone and Private Key is kept private.

Algorithm
Step 1 : Choose two prime numbers p and q.
Step 2 : Calculate n = p*q
Step 3 : Calculate  ϕ(n) = (p – 1) * (q – 1)
Step 4 : Choose e such that gcd(e , ϕ(n) ) = 1
Step 5 : Calculate d such that e*d mod ϕ(n) = 1
Step 6 : Public Key {e,n} Private Key {d,n}
Step 7 : Cipher text C = Pe mod n  where P = plaintext
Step 8 : For Decryption D = Dd mod n where D will give back the plaintext.
